// Browser tests for tuios-web, run against real servers on real viewports.
//
// The browser is the system chromium, so nothing is downloaded. Everything
// here asserts what reached the wire or what the terminal buffer says, and
// never a frame rate: the headless GL is software rasterization.
//
// The appearance suite is the one exception and reads pixels, because a colour
// is the claim and a colour is the one thing software rasterization gets
// exactly right. It pins the renderer to canvas, because a WebGL drawing
// buffer cannot be read back without preserveDrawingBuffer.
//
// One server per suite, because each suite needs a different config file. The
// touch tests want tuios as it ships, the config tests want a file full of
// values that are deliberately not the defaults, and the appearance tests want
// a theme. Sharing a server would also mean sharing a daemon and the session
// inside it, so whichever suite attached first would size the session for the
// other one's viewport.
