// Learn mode is the guided tour at tuios.dev/learn, where tuios runs as
// WebAssembly in a browser tab with a fake shell in every pane (see
// cmd/tuios-wasm). Two things differ from a normal session there:
//
//   - Nothing quits. Closing the tab is the way out, and a quit key that ended
//     the program would leave a beginner staring at a dead terminal. Every quit
//     path shows a friendly note instead.
//   - Anything that needs a daemon, a real process, the network or the host's
//     files is not there. Those actions show a note that says so, instead of the
//     error the missing piece would otherwise produce.
//
// Everything else is the real tuios.

// Notes shown in Learn mode. Short, friendly, and never an error.
